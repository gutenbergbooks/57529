<h2 id="c1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Every American, since his early school days, has been definitely conscious of the
two tranquil New England towns which share the distinction of being the birthplace
of the American Revolution. Their story has been told so well and so often, in prose, poetry
and historical writing, that this small volume would have scant <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> if it were not
for the fact that good pictures of Lexington and Concord are curiously rare.</p>
<p>Visual reminders of those stirring days still exist in surprising number all over this countryside.
The scenes of the heroic stands made by the minutemen on Lexington Common
and at Concord Bridge have been preserved virtually unchanged, thanks to the vigilance of
patriotic citizens. The buildings most intimately associated with the epochal events of April
19, 1775 are still in place, to add their eloquent testimony to the story that every schoolchild
knows so well. Even more personal are the homes of Concord&rsquo;s authors, which remain
to give a graphic insight into the days of the 19th century when Concord was a significant
center of American culture. Spared the unlovely intrusion of factories by their inland sites,
these calm townships have kept their rural beauty. Their natural landscape remains unblemished,
a pure joy today as it was in Thoreau&rsquo;s time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Historical importance here is matched by physical beauty, a fact which strikes every visitor
forcibly, and which this little book strives to prove by a series of photographic impressions.
These have been taken in all seasons of the year, to portray the varied moods of the countryside.
The pictures follow a path approximating the march of the British on that historic
morning of April 19, 1775. Beginning in the neighborhood of East Lexington and the
Munroe Tavern, on the eastern outskirts of Lexington, they progress to the Battle Green
and the Hancock-Clarke house in Lexington, then along the Battle Road through Lincoln,
and finally down Concord&rsquo;s legendary streets, ending at Concord Bridge where the British
fired the &ldquo;shot heard round the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visitors who have had the enriching experience of following a similar path come away
with an inspired picture of this epic moment in American history. These pages do not attempt
to record the familiar written story of Lexington and Concord, but they do aspire to
capture a fragment of this inspired picture, as it exists today.</p>

<p class="caphead">A CORNER OF THE EARL PERCY ROOM, MUNROE TAVERN</p>
<p class="capbody">The Munroe Tavern, built in 1695, was occupied by Earl Percy when he reached Lexington
with reinforcements on the afternoon of April 19, 1775. The old hostelry was used as a
hospital and headquarters for the British while the landlord, Sergeant William Munroe
was playing his part with the minutemen, and his wife and children were hiding fearfully
in the woods. Sergeant Munroe left the tavern in charge of a crippled neighbor, John Raymond,
who was shot.</p>
<p class="capbody">The room above was originally the dining room, and is now dedicated to Earl Percy and
filled with a rich collection of Revolutionary relics. The facade of the tavern was altered
when it became a private residence, and it has only recently been restored to its former
character, from data revealed in an old etching.</p>

a British bullet hole in the ceiling and the original tavern sign, cut out of one piece of hard
white pine, which hung outside the door.</p>

then Colonel Munroe, cleared this bedchamber and arranged it as a private dining room
for the distinguished guest. Washington sat in the chair at the left. The Sheraton table and
the hat rack are the same ones used by him. The dishes used for the occasion are also preserved.</p>

Paul Revere witnessed the arrival of the British from a chamber window. In the
afternoon of April 19th two wounded British soldiers were given first aid here. One of
them died shortly after, and was buried in the old cemetery. The Buckman Tavern, which
was the oldest of Lexington&rsquo;s twelve inns, still contains scars of British bullets. The first
village store was located here, and later, in 1812 it held Lexington&rsquo;s first Post Office. The
building contains many noteworthy exhibits besides the famous tap room, and is now in
the care of the Lexington Historical Society.</p>

The third pastor of the village was a much respected man, Reverend Jonas Clarke. He occupied
the house in 1755 and was still its host on April 18, 1775 when John Hancock and
Samuel Adams, facing imprisonment if they were caught by the British, took refuge there.
John Hancock&rsquo;s aunt and his fiancee, Dorothy Quincy, were also staying in the house.
During the night the two patriots were roused from their sleep by Paul Revere, and were
conducted to Burlington for their safety. Dorothy Quincy followed the party, bringing
along a fine salmon which had been sent in for their dinner.</p>

midnight ride of Paul Revere ended. In company with William Dawes and Dr. Samuel Prescott,
Paul Revere was halted by a British patrol. Dawes escaped, as did Dr. Prescott, who
went on to give the alarm at Concord, but Revere was arrested and taken back to Lexington.
There he was released, and later joined John Hancock and Samuel Adams.</p>
<p class="capbody">The Samuel Hartwell house, now known as the Hartwell Farm, is one of the survivors
along the Battle Road. Past its front door the red-coated Grenadiers matched with smart
precision on the morning of April 19th. They returned in the afternoon, with broken ranks
and no semblance of military order, harassed by the minutemen. One Grenadier pushed his
broken musket through a window of the house and left it there, and several fired bullets
into its boarded facade.</p>

Alcott gave the house the name of &ldquo;Hillside&rdquo; during his stay from 1845 to 1848. Louisa
and her sisters spent a few impressionable years of their girlhood here, and gave their plays
in the barn. Nathaniel Hawthorne bought the house from the Alcotts in 1852, renamed it
&ldquo;The Wayside&rdquo; and lived here until his death in 1864. As a refuge from visitors, Hawthorne
built a tower, or &ldquo;sky parlor,&rdquo; where he wrote &ldquo;Tanglewood Tales&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Marble
Faun.&rdquo; A later owner was Mrs. Daniel Lothrop who, under the name of &ldquo;Margaret Sidney,&rdquo;
wrote many volumes of the &ldquo;Five Little Peppers&rdquo; during her forty years&rsquo; residence
here. The house dates from the early 18th century.</p>

<p class="caphead">THE OLD MANSE (<i>view from the northwest</i>)</p>
<p class="capbody">This large gambrel-roofed homestead was built in 1769 by the Reverend William Emerson,
Concord&rsquo;s fighting minister. Its grounds border the Concord River, and the minister
is said to have viewed the battle at North Bridge from the window of his study. His grandson,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, spent much time in the old house as a schoolboy, and later
lived here for a year, writing &ldquo;Nature&rdquo; during that period. Nathaniel Hawthorne rented
the house in 1842, and brought his bride there, to occupy it for some four years. It was
Hawthorne who named it &ldquo;The Old Manse,&rdquo; and it was his &ldquo;Mosses from an Old Manse&rdquo;
that made it known to the world. The house has undergone astonishingly little change
since it was built 170 years ago.</p>

<p class="capbody">The Battleground by North Bridge is marked by this monument, erected in 1836. Nearby
is a tablet marking the graves of two British soldiers killed in the fight. The present bridge
is a concrete copy of the original wooden bridge, abandoned in 1794. Here was fired the
&ldquo;shot that was heard round the world.&rdquo; Here is the setting of Longfellow&rsquo;s immortal poem.
Here was the turning point in America&rsquo;s struggle for independence.</p>

<p class="capbody">&ldquo;The Minuteman,&rdquo; first important
Statue by Daniel Chester French,
stands guard over the Battleground.
The spirited young farmer is leaving
his plow to answer the alarm, musket
in hand. The sculptor, unable to afford
a living model, is said to have
used a statue of Apollo Belvedere
dressed as a minuteman for the purpose.
The scene of this bloody and
momentous battle is now the picture
of calm repose, and a shrine for innumerable
visitors.</p>
<p class="capbody">The Story of the battle is eloquently
related by a tablet on the scene:</p>
<p class="center">CONCORD FIGHT</p>
<p class="capbody">&ldquo;On the morning of April Nineteenth,
1775, while the British held
this bridge, the minutemen and militia
of Concord and neighboring towns
gathered on the hill across the river.
There the Concord Adjutant, Joseph
Hosmer, demanded, &lsquo;Will you let
them burn the town down?&rsquo; There
the Lincoln captain, William Smith, offered to dislodge the British, the Acton captain, Isaac
Davis, said, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t a man that&rsquo;s afraid to go!&rsquo; and the Concord colonel, James Barrett,
ordered the attack upon the regulars.</p>
<p class="capbody">The column was led by Major John Buttrick, marching from his own farm. His aide was
Lt. Colonel John Robinson of Westford. The minutemen of Acton, Concord, Lincoln and
Bedford followed, after them came the militia. At the British volley, Isaac Davis fell. Buttrick
cried, &lsquo;Fire, fellow-soldiers, for God&rsquo;s sake Fire!&rsquo; and himself fired first. The British fled;
and here began the separation of two kindred nations, now happily long united in peace.&rdquo;</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
